Simple full-screen slide show with nice fade transition effect written in Python/PyGame.

Upon execution it will start display all .jpg's in directory '1' from current directory until you hit escape key.

If you hit any other key it will try to display images from that one-letter directory. If no such directory
exists it will start displaying directory 'n' - you can put there big red "No such directory" image.
